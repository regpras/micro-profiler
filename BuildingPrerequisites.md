You may build sources using VisualStudio 2008 SP1+, 2010 or 2012. Profiler core (micro-profiler.dll) is being developed using TDD, so you may run its tests, by selecting **micro-profiler.tests** project as startup and running it. VisualStudio integrated testing framework is used.

You will have the following software installed to build from sourcecode:
  * VisualStudio 2008 SP1+;
  * WIX (Windows Installer XML) Toolset (v3.8.1128.0 works ok);
  * SVN command line tools (to make version stamps).
